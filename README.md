## Top-Level
*Genre generators* are text generators that use basic tools for using and manipulating text with a digital computer to create new instances of a written genre. This repo contains instructional materials for instructors teaching a course that does not (necessarily) involve coding, but want to guide students through an activity that can facilitate their understanding of programming and code as *sociotechnical* practices, or practices that mediate human concepts and the world around them through the technical limitations and affordances of digital computer technology. It does so by integrating a rhetorical understanding of a written genre, the *love letter*, and implementations in code of Christopher Strachey's Love Letter Generator by Matt Sephton (https://www.gingerbeardman.com/loveletter/) and Annette Vee (https://jsfiddle.net/nettework/6f7abaaa/).

For more information about the initial context of this assignment, please read my contribution to the *TextGenEd* open collection (https://wac.colostate.edu/repository/collections/textgened/rhetorical-engagements/genre-generators/), which this repository is part of. There you will learn more about the course this activity was designed for as well as what kinds of courses this activity could be implemented into.

## Contents
* `instructional-guide.md` walks the instructor through the work in the two in-class sessions needed to perform this activity

* `student-program.pdf` is a sample generator program designed by students as part of the in-class activity without alteration; the names of students have been included after reaching out to them and receiving permission to use their work with the option to remain anonymous, and in each case students indicated a preference for using their full name, which I am more than happy to do in recognition of their contributions to the success of this activity

* `student-generator.ipynb` is the Jupyter Notebook I made based on student-program.pdf to implement their program in code, which was in turn used for the second session of the activity, as described in `instructional-guide.md`

* `generator-template.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook template that combines Markdown and Python similarly to `student-generator.ipynb`, but includes minimal specifics for easy re-use by other instructors; any text in Markdown or Python comments between square brackets `[]` should be replaced or deleted based on the needs of the genre generator, although the entire structure of the document could readily be reworked based on those same needs along with the path through the code that the instructor feels most comfortable taking

## Credit
One detail from the *TextGenEd* introduction I want to highlight is that this activity was designed for "Digital Humanity," a course I originally co-taught with Alison Langmead. While I designed the activity for the subsequent semester, where I taught the class on my own, I would not have come up with the concept if not for what I learned during the collaborative teaching process.

I would also like to reiterate my appreciation for the students—as named in `student-program.pdf` and `student-generator.ipynb`, Anna Ligorio, Lauren Hevron, Austin McKenna, and Emily Schultz—who have each given permission for me to share their collaborative work that was part of the initial run of this activity. Their work provides a fantastic example of the ways students can take this activity and make something creative and useful for drawing out the utility of the assignment.
